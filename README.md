# food-security-nb
Global Food Security Notebook

## Background

This repository features visualizations from previous graduate work. The reports were developed using Jupyter Notebook and a Shiny App written in R. The goal, as per the original assignment from the course, was to analyze datasets and gain new observations from various perspectives using different visualization libraries. The selected dataset focuses on UN data surrounding global food security. All preprocessing and data cleaning was performed within the notebooks.

## Visualization Libraries Used

The following R and Python libraries were used to design the visualizations:

 - Pandas
 - Matplot
 - Seaborn
 - Altair
 - ggplot2
 - Girafe

## Research

Beyond creating the visualizations, a personal goal was conducting extensive research about the subject matter to better inform the overall direction of the data analysis. This preliminary work built the foundation for the report and helped guide any conclusions drawn from the visualizations.
